          You might alreay know me or the organization I worked in. I am an ex employee of Cyber 71.
          I had been working. <br>
          there since 2018. I recently retired from my post. Now, I want to gather experience in other feilds of IT
          sector. <br>
          To tell the absolute truth about me, I was quite lazy. But last three years I worked my a** off. It was quite
          the journey for me. In this journey, I learned a lot of things on productivity, passive income ideas, social
          interaction, business mindset and so much more. I had also read a lot of books to gain knowledge. Tried new
          things to boost my income. Now, I want to share my experience with You. I want to guide you. <br>
          I also am a top rated freelancer on Upwork. I still work on random projects related to SEO & Digital Marketing
          there. I charge $20/hour now and I always try to do one/two projects a month on Upwork. <br>
