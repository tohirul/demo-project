        You might alreay know me or the organization I worked in. I am an ex employee of Cyber 71.
        I had been working. <br>
        there since 2018. I recently retired from my post. Now, I want to gather experience in other feilds of IT
        sector. <br>
        To tell the absolute truth about me, I was quite lazy. But last three years I worked my a** off. It was quite
        the journey for me. In this journey, I learned a lot of things on productivity, passive income ideas, social
        interaction, business mindset and so much more. I had also read a lot of books to gain knowledge. Tried new
        things to boost my income. Now, I want to share my experience with You. I want to guide you. <br>
        I also am a top rated freelancer on Upwork. I still work on random projects related to SEO & Digital Marketing
        there. I charge $20/hour now and I always try to do one/two projects a month on Upwork. <br>

      <h4 class="orange">SEO Expert | Digital Marketer | IT Expert</h4>
      <p>
        I have already learned the basics of SEO and Digital Marketing. Now, I am looking forward to gather some
        experience from Working online as a freelancer. After working for about a year I probably will go for
        professional job as an expert in both criteria.
        I was want to gather knowledge on Data Analytics. After two or three years of working as a Marketing expert I
        will switch to analytics. <br>
        I hope to succeed in every goal I lay my eyes on to. I am ready to work hard no matter what happens.
        Failure occurs everyday, in school, jobs, housework, and within families. It is unavoidable, irritating and
        causes pessimism. <br>
        While the thought of flinging your hands in the air and walking away is all too appealing, take a second to
        connect with the people who have been there and survived. <br>
